# Clinical-Named-Entity-Recognition-in-Electronic-Medical-Records-Based-on-the-LSTM-CRF-Model
This paper proposes the LSTM-CRF model for Chinese electronic medical record entity recognition, combining sequence modeling with label transition optimization to achieve an F1 score of 93.41%. Experiments demonstrate that its performance outperforms single CRF/LSTM models without requiring additional data overhead.
